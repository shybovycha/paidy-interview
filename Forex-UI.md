# Paidy Take-Home Coding Exercises

## What we are looking for?
**Keep it simple**. Read the requirements and restrictions carefully and focus on solving the problem.

**Treat it like production code**. That is, develop your software in the same way that you would for any code that is intended to be deployed to production. These may be toy exercises, but we really would like to get an idea of how you build code on a day-to-day basis.

## How to submit?
You can do this however you see fit - you can email us a tarball, a pointer to download your code from somewhere or just a link to a source control repository. Make sure your submission includes a small **README**, documenting any assumptions, simplifications and/or choices you made, as well as a short description of how to run the code and/or tests. Finally, to help us review your code, please split your commit history in sensible chunks.

# An in-browser Forex rates SPA

Build a Single Page Application displaying Forex rates information which you get through an api.

## Requirements

We would like to see an in-browser application that creates an interface over the [One-Frame API](https://hub.docker.com/r/paidyinc/one-frame). You can display the information in whatever way you wish to (graphs, icons, animations, ...), but try to make it both appealing as well as insightful for the end-user.

Amongst others, we at least expect the following to be addressed:

- being able to select which currency pair to display the information for
- when selecting a new currency pair, the data displayed should transition nicely
- the end-user should be able to refresh the data fetched. If the data is updated, a similar transition would happen.
- make sure you handle failure modes. Some examples of the latter are:
  - the api takes a long time before returning data
  - the api doesn't respond

### The One-Frame service

#### How to run locally

* Pull the docker image with `docker pull paidyinc/one-frame`
* Run the service locally on port 8080 with `docker run -p 8080:8080 paidyinc/one-frame`

#### Usage
__API__

The One-Frame API offers two different APIs, for this exercise please use the streaming one, This is a never ending stream, after opening a connection the API will keep returning new exchange rates for the queried currency pairs until the connection is closed.

```
GET /streaming/rates?pair={currency_pair_0}&pair={currency_pair_1}&...pair={currency_pair_n}
```

* `pair`: Required query parameter that is the concatenation of two different currency codes, e.g. `USDJPY`. One or more pairs per request are allowed.

* `token`: Header required for authentication. `10dc303535874aeccc86a8251e6992f5` is the only accepted value in the current implementation.

__Example cURL request__
```
$ curl --no-buffer -s -H "token: 10dc303535874aeccc86a8251e6992f5" 'localhost:8080/streaming/rates?pair=USDJPY'

## F.A.Q.
1) _Is it OK to share your solutions publicly?_
Yes, the questions are not prescriptive, the process and discussion around the code is the valuable part. You do the work, you own the code. Given we are asking you to give up your time, it is entirely reasonable for you to keep and use your solution as you see fit.

2) _Should I do X?_
For any value of X, it is up to you, we intentionally leave the problem a little open-ended and will leave it up to you to provide us with what you see as important. Just remember to keep it simple. If it's a feature that is going to take you a couple of days, it's not essential.

3) _Something is ambiguous, and I don't know what to do?_
The first thing is: don't get stuck. We really don't want to trip you up intentionally, we are just attempting to see how you approach problems. That said, there are intentional ambiguities in the specifications, mainly to see how you fill in those gaps, and how you make design choices.
If you really feel stuck, our first preference is for you to make a decision and document it with your submission - in this case there is really no wrong answer. If you feel it is not possible to do this, just send us an email and we will try to clarify or correct the question for you.

4) _Can i use X library, technology, framework ?_
Yes, you have complete freedom on how you choose to solve the exercise.

We understand that your time is valuable, and in anyoneâ€™s busy schedule solving these exercises may constitute a fairly substantial chunk of time, so we really appreciate any effort you put in to helping us build a solid team.
Good luck!
